      <em
        >The Rule is a 2024 Indian Telugu-language action drama film[8] written
        and directed by Sukumar and produced by Mythri Movie Makers in
        association with Sukumar Writings. A sequel to Pushpa: The Rise (2021),
        it is the second installment in the Pushpa film series. The film stars
        Allu Arjun in the titular role, alongside Rashmika Mandanna, Fahadh
        Faasil, Jagapathi Babu, Sunil and Rao Ramesh. It follows Pushpa Raj, a
        labourer-turned-red sandalwood smuggler, as he faces growing threats
        from his enemies, including SP Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat. The sequel was
        officially announced in December 2021, shortly before the release of the
        first film, with the title Pushpa 2 and later rebranded as Pushpa 2: The
        Rule with the release of the first film.[9][10] Although a portion of
        the film was initially shot back-to-back with the first film, director
        Sukumar revised the storyline, leading to principal photography
        beginning in October 2022. The film features music composed by Devi Sri
        Prasad, cinematography by Mirosław Kuba Brożek, and editing by Naveen
        Nooli. Made on a budget of ₹400–500 crore,[3][11] it is among the most
        expensive Indian films ever produced. With a runtime of 200–224
        minutes,[12][2] it is also one of the longest Indian films</em

      <strong>RRR</strong><em> is a 2022 Indian Telugu-language epic period action
      drama film directed by S. S. Rajamouli, who co-wrote the screenplay with
      V. Vijayendra Prasad.[9] Produced by D. V. V. Danayya under DVV
      Entertainment, the film stars N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan as
      fictionalised versions of Indian revolutionaries Komaram Bheem and Alluri
      Sitarama Raju, respectively. It also features Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt,
      Shriya Saran, Samuthirakani, Ray Stevenson, Alison Doody and Olivia Morris
      in supporting roles. It marks the Telugu film debuts of Devgn, Bhatt,
      Stevenson, Doody and Morris. The film is a fictionalised tale of two
      historical freedom fighters, set in the Indian pre-independence era.[10]
      Rajamouli conceptualised the film by reimagining the lives of Sitarama
      Raju and Bheem, envisioning their meeting in 1920s Delhi as two formidable
      forces uniting to battle British colonial rule. The film was officially
      announced in March 2018, and principal photography began in November 2018
      in Hyderabad. The production faced delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic and
      concluded in August 2021. RRR was shot extensively across India, with
      additional sequences filmed in Ukraine and Bulgaria. The film's songs and
      background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani, with cinematography by
      K. K. Senthil Kumar and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad. Sabu Cyril served as
      the production designer, and V. Srinivas Mohan supervised the visual
      effects.</em>
